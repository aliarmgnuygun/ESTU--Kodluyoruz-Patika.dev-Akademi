--- Merge Sort Algorithm ---

[16,21,11,8,12,22] --> Merge Sort


1.	[16,21,11] - [8,12,22]

2.  [16,21] [11] - [8,12] [22]     

3.  [16] [21] [11] - [8] [12] [22]  

4.  [16,21] [11]  -  [8] [12,22]

5.  [11,16,21]   -   [8,12,22]

6.  [8,11,16,21,22]




Big-O notation: 

2^x= n, logn= x,

O(n) for each steps

thus, O(nlogn)
